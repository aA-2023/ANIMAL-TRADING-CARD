			<p>The front and back of the American bison have different shades of brown fur. It protects
				the bison from the rough elements of the plains, spanning Mexico to Canada.
				They are often referred to as Buffalo, which are Asian. They can reach up to 11 and a half feet in length and are fast
				and agile, despite their lumbering appearance. They fertilize the soil as they thrust their
				hooves into the soil.
