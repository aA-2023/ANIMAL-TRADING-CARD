Animal Trading Cards Project for Udacity's Web Nanodegree Programs.

# Project Requirements
Used existing HTML, CSS knowledge and MDN, Google, etc to lookup more information to complete project.

Downloaded zip file containing card.html, styles.css, placeholder.png, and the design-prototype.png (very imporant, the mockup I needed to duplicate).

The final result after editing the HTML file with the animal's textual information, and some design elements, was to style the rest using a linked Cascading Style Sheet file.

Italics, bolds, customzed list properties (removed dots), borders, spacing, padding, the alt tag on the image, rounded corners on the trading card were used.

After working on everything in VS Code, and the project passed on Udacity, the finished files were uploaded to Github
